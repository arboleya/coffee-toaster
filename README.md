# Coffee Toaster (current version - 0.5.0)

CoffeeToaster is a dependency manager and build system for CoffeeScript.

The main purpose is to provide a very comfortable environment to code large<BR>
libraries using such things as class definitions and namespaces, in order to<BR>
to help avoid naming collisions in your architecture.

A smart 'require' powered by wild-cards is also provided, together with a<BR>
powerful build system that concatenates everything and outputs a single<BR>
javascript release file that can be even minified if you like.

The build system was developed to offer vendors support as well as merging<BR>
routines for multiple modules, with specific ordering options. If you are<BR>
adept of the extends directive in CoffeeScript, Toaster will even check if<BR>
you have required base classes for the classes that extends another.

The CLI program informs you about everything that is happening when a new<BR>
file is created, deleted or modified. You can even drag'n'drop a folder with<BR>
lots of CoffeeScript files inside your source folder and everything will be<BR>
handled gracefully.

If you are building for the browser you can use the debug option to compile<BR>
everything individually -- plus, node targeted support is on the way. In <BR>
debug mode you'll be gifted with a boot-loader that will load every file in<BR>
the proper order according your needs.

Keep on reading this README, and please do not hesitate to open a feature<BR>
request or a bug report.<BR>

be answered sooner than later.<BR>

# Installation

	npm install -g coffee-toaster

# Usage

## Creating a new App

CoffeeToaster suggests a very simple structure for initial projects, you can<BR>
customize it as you like.

	toaster -n mynewapp

You will be asked for some things:

1. **name** - The name of your main module.
  * i.e.: mynewapp
1. **src** - The source folder for your main module -- the path can be<BR>
relative or absolute.
  * i.e.: src
1. **release** - The release file for your main module -- the path can be<BR>
relative or absolute.
  * i.e.: release/app.js

Considering all the default values, you'll end up with a structure as such:

	├── /mynewapp
	    ├── /release
	    ├── /src
	    └── toaster.coffee

The toaster.coffee file will have this content:

````ruby
module 'basic'
	# mandatory config
	src: 'src'
	release: 'release/app.js'

	# optional config
	vendors: []
	bare: false # default=false
	packaging: true # default=false
	exports: false # default=false
	minify: false # default=false
````


## Toasting an existing project

Your can toast an existing project as such:

	cd existing-project
	toaster -i

Or:

	toaster -i existing-project

The same information (name, src, release) will be required -- answer<BR>
everything according to your project's structure.

A 'toaster.coffee' file will be created inside it.

## When the magic happens

To see all that CoffeeToaster can do for you, enter the project folder and<BR>
type 'toaster -w' after creating or toasting a new project:

	cd existing-project
	toaster -w

Or:

	toaster -w existing-project

Your release file will be saved according to your needs.

# Debug Mode

In debug mode (option -d) all files will be compiled individually inside a<BR>
folder called "toaster" in the same directory you have your release file,<BR>
aiming to ease the debugging process.

	cd existing-project
	toaster -wd

For example, if you have "release/app.js", a folder will be created in<BR>
"release/toaster" and all your CoffeeScript files will be compiled to<BR>
Javascript within.

Bellow is a representative directory structure:

	├── release
	│   ├── app.js
	│   ├── index.html
	│   └── toaster
	│       ├── src
	│       │   ├── app.js
	│       │   ├── letters
	│       │   │   ├── a.js
	│       │   │   └── b.js
	│       │   ├── repeating
	│       │   │   └── a.js
	│       │   └── single
	│       │       └── script.js
	│       └── toaster.js
	├── src
	│   ├── app.coffee
	│   ├── letters
	│   │   ├── a.coffee
	│   │   └── b.coffee
	│   ├── repeating
	│   │   └── a.coffee
	│   └── single
	│       └── script.coffee
	└── toaster.coffee

There's also a 'toaster.js' file inside the 'release/toaster' folder which<BR>
is responsible to load all your files into the right order.

So in your .html you'll have two options:

**1)** Include your release file (release/app.js)

````html
	<script src="app.js"></script>
````
 
**2)** Include the toaster boot-loader (release/toaster/toaster.js)

````html
	<script src="toaster/toaster.js"></script>
````


# How does everything work?

CoffeeToaster will create a file called 'toaster.coffee' in your app main folder.

## Config File (toaster.coffee)

This file contains information on the modules you have in your app, i.e:

````ruby
module 'my_awesome_app'

	# mandatory config
	src: 'src'
	release: 'release/app.js'
	
	# optional config
	vendors: []
	bare: false # default=false
	packaging: true # default=false
	exports: false # default=false
	minify: false # default=false
````

So when you call 'toaster -w' in this directory, this config is loaded and<BR>
every file and folder inside 'src' folder will be watched.

If debug is enabled (option -d), files will be also compiled individually<BR>
for a sane debugging routine, inside the browser.

Every time something changes, CoffeeToaster re-compiles all of your<BR>
application by:

* collecting all .coffee files and processing everything, adding package<BR>
declarations to class definitions, based on the folder they are located
* re-ordering everything, always defining files and classes before<BR>
they're needed

Hold it! How the hell does it know when my files or classes are needed?

## Import directive

The import directive is known by:

 * #<< mvc/views/user_view
 * #<< utils/*

By putting '#<< package/name/View' in your CoffeeScript file, you're telling<BR>
CoffeeToaster that there's a dependency.

Wild cards '#<< utils/*' are also accepted as a handy option.

## Vendors

You can define vendors such as:

````ruby
vendor 'jquery', 'vendors/jquery.js'
vendor '_', 'vendors/_.js'
````

Basically you name it and inform where it is, and the file must be purely<BR>
in javascript, preferably minified ones -- Toaster will not compile or<BR>
minify them, only concatenate everything.


## Multi Modules

You can have as many modules as you want such as:

````ruby
module 'foo'
	src: 'foo'
	release: 'release/foo.js'

module 'boo'
	src: 'boo'
	release: 'release/boo.js'
````

In order to concatenate multiple modules, you will need to use build routines.

## Build Routines

Build routines are simple specifications where you tell Toaster how to build<BR>
your library. You can have as many modules and vendors as you want.

````ruby
vendor 'jquery', 'vendors/jquery.js'
vendor '_', 'vendors/_.js'

module 'foo'
	src: 'foo'
	vendors: ['jquery', "_"]
	release: 'release/foo.js'

module 'boo'
	src: 'boo'
	vendors: ['jquery','_']
	release: 'release/boo.js'

build 'foo_first_then_boo'
	modules: ['foo', 'boo']
	release: 'release/animals_insects.js'

build 'boo_first_then_foo'
	modules: ['boo', 'foo']
	release: 'release/insects_animals.js'
````

Note that the array order you choose when informing the modules for your<BR>
build will be preserved.

## Minify Support

To minify you release file all you need to do is turn on the minify<BR>
property in the 'toaster.coffee' file for your desired module.

````ruby
module 'foo'
	src: 'foo'
	release: 'release/foo.js'
	minify: true
````

# Examples

You'll certainly find some useful resources in the two examples provided.<BR>
Examine them and you'll understand how things works more instinctively.

Install coffee-toaster, clone the examples and try different config options<BR>
always looking for the differences in your javascript release file.

## Basic Example

This example uses:

* One single module
* Two vendors

There are files and classes with the same name to show the packaging system.

The packaging system will address every class definition to a namespace,that<BR>
is computed automatically according to the path where your physical file is.

Imagine that you have a class "Foo" inside a "my/path/foo.coffee" file. This<BR>
class will be addressed to the namespace "my.path", so you can instantiate it:

	# usual way
	new Foo
	
	# unique way using the packaging system
	new my.path.Foo

## Multi-Modules Example

This example uses:

* Two modules
* Two vendors
* Two build-configs with different merging options to show possibilities

The packaging system is enabled here as well, but you can always turn it off<BR>
to see what happens, try different options and do not forget to check the<BR>
differences in your javascript release file.
